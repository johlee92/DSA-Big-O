Question 1 - What is the Big O for this?
Part 1 - O(1)
Part 2 - O(n)

Question 2 - Even or odd
O(1)
Regardless of the size of the input, the # of operations remains the same.

Question 3 - Are you here?
Assume length of arr1 = x
Assume length of arr2 = y
O(x * y)
O(n ^ 2)
It has two levels of looping over an input in the algorithm, resulting in a polynomial time O.

Question 4 - Doubler
O(n)
It's a linear time complexity because the running time is directly proportional to input.

Question 5 - Naive search
O(n)
It's a linear time complexity because the running time is directly proportional to input. 

Question 6 - Creating pairs
Double loop --> O(n ^ 2)

Question 7 - Compute the sequence
O(n)
The for loop is the growing operations, resulting in a linear complexity

Question 8 - An efficient search
O(log(n))
The search is narrowing via the currentIndex.

Question 9 - Random element
O(1)
Regardless of the size of the input, the # of operations remains the same.

Question 10 - What am I?
O(n)
The for loop is the growing operations, resulting in a linear complexity
